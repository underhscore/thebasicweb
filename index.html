<h2 class="endashsubtext">Other Uses</h2>
 <p>
En dashes could also represent things without having number values attached to it. For example, a vaild use of an en dash 
without using a number value could be the 
sentence <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/language-rules/dashes/" style="text-decoration: none;"
>"The Amsterdam–Berlin train departs 
 at nine o’clock."</a> Or the sentence <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/language-rules/dashes/" style="text-decoration: none;">Clear 
  communication is key to an effective editor–author relationship.
 </a>. These sentences work because they still make sense with the replaced
 words ( "to" and "and")

 <h1>The Two Types Of Dashes</h1>
<h2>What are em dashes?</h2>
 <p>
Em dashes (—) are interruptions or changes in tone in a sentence. They provide additional information 
that isn't directly needed to understand a text. This can be in the form of informing a reader or showing a thought in a regular story.
One key note on the correct usage of Em dashes is that if they're in the middle of sentences you close them off, while ones at the 
end of a sentence don't need cut-offs
  <br> <br>
   Em dashes can also be thought of taking the place of parenthesis. Flip the cards below for details on how to use Em dashes.

<h1>Common Mistakes with Dashes</h1>
<p>
 As i stated earilier in the text, Hyphens often get confused with dashes. As the both have seperate uses 
 but look very simular. Here are some common mistakes when using dashes.
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Putting em dashes at the end of sentences when thats not needed</li>
 <li>There is no "rule" to using dashes but using them excessively may be too much</li>
 <li>Using the wrong symbol of dashes (ex using an en dash in place of a em dash and visa-versa)</li>
 <li>Not correctly drawing / typing the lines ( note: En dash are as long as the letter "n" while em dashes is as long as an "m")</li>
 <li>etc</li>

</ul>
