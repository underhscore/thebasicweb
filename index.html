A Dash <span style="color: darkgrey;">(or)</span>
Dashes is a punctuation mark which has 2 primary ways of using it.
The first way of using it to make an interruption in a sentence or express an idea. 
While the other is used to describe a range of numbers or time. Dashes are often mistaken with hyphens, while (em) dashes are used 
to seperate ideas/words, hyphens usually join words together.


  <br> <br>
   When we are refering to <i>Dashes</i>, 
   There are two types of them. <strong>En Dashes</strong> 
   and <strong>Em Dashes</strong>. <span style="color: darkgrey;">

the words "to" and "and".

<h2 class="endashsubtext">Other Uses</h2>
 <p>
En dashes could also represent things without having number values attached to it (as long as they have a realtionship to each other. For example, a vaild use of an en dash 
without using a number value could be the 
sentence <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/language-rules/dashes/" style="text-decoration: none;"
>"The Amsterdam–Berlin train departs 
 at nine o’clock."</a> Or the sentence <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/language-rules/dashes/" style="text-decoration: none;">Clear 
  communication is key to an effective editor–author relationship.
 </a>. These sentences work because they still make sense with the replaced
 words ( "to" and "and")

 <h1>The Two Types Of Dashes</h1>
<h2>What are em dashes?</h2>
 <p>
Em dashes (—) are interruptions in the middle or end of a sentence. They provide additional information 
that isn't directly needed to understand a text, they can also be an idea or thought.
One key note on the correct usage of Em dashes is that if they're in the middle of sentences you close them off
  (Closing off —em dashes look like— this.) , while ones at the 
end of a sentence don't need cut-offs (closing off —em dashes at the end of a sentence looks like this.)
  <br> <br>
   Em dashes can also take the place of parenthesis. Flip the cards below for details on how to use Em dashes.

 Em dashes are are also used to signal a change in thought in sentences. 
 Another example of a em dash could be <a href="https://writingcenter.uagc.edu/dashes" style="text-decoration: none;">Faith, hope, and 
  love—these virtues are very important to me.</a>
